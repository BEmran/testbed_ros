libusdusb4 v1.3
---------------

You will find three tar files in the release folder:

   - libusdusb4_1.3_i386.deb
   - libusdusb4_1.3_amd64.deb
   - usb4_linux_demos.tar.gz

The first two are identical other than being specifically 
compiled for 32-bit or 64-bit platforms. They include the
driver library and other files required to configure
the USB4. 


Installation
------------
The packages will correctly install on Ubuntu Desktop 
12.04.5 LTS or later. Although they should also work fine 
on other Debian-based distributions, such usage is not 
supported.

To install use dpkg:

  sudo dpkg -i libusdusb4_1.3_nnnn.deb

substituting the name of the appropriate package.

Upon installation, the library can be found in /usr/lib 
and the include file in /usr/include.

The user manual, along with the copyright information, 
is located in /usr/share/doc/libusdusb4.


Demos
-----
usb4_linux_demos.tar.gz contains some samples of how to use
several of the USB4 features. For your convenience, each 
sample includes a CMakeLists.txt file to generate build
scripts using cmake. Their use is completely optional and
the source files can be compiled with any other preferred
build mechanism.

A full API reference is available in the user's manual.
